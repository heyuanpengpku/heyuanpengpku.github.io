abstract: >-
  To address highly conflicting evidence combinations, a new base function is proposed to alleviate conflicts that exist in pieces of evidence provided before the fusion of them to get intuitive results from the combination. The proposed method assigns a corresponding value to each proposition according to its importance. Single subset propositions are considered more crucial than multiple ones, which intends to reduce uncertainties existing in the frame of discernment so that indicative results of combination can be obtained. More than that, to avoid a considerable deviation from the modified mass to the original ones, an operation of average is carried out twice to achieve this effect. The proposed conflicting management method not only has the advantage of eliminating conflicts among evidence but also the ability to produce intuitive results. Several numerical examples and experiments using datasets are illustrated to verify the accuracy and correctness of the proposed method in processing highly conflicting information.
