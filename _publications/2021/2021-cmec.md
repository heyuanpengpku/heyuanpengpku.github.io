abstract: >-
  An open issue of the Dempster combination rule is the conflicting management, which is very important in multisource data fusion, such as group decision making and target recognition. To address this issue, an improved method to generate basic probability assignment is presented. Then, a new combination method to assign the conflicting mass function without the normalization is proposed to handle a highly conflicting environment. Compared with other methods, this proposed method is convenient in computing and has better accuracy to predict potential possibilities especially when disposing of extreme status. Some numerical examples and real benchmark data collected in UCI database are illustrated to verify the validity and rationality of the proposed method.
