abstract: >-
  Quantum mass function has been applied in lots of fields because of its efficiency and validity of managing uncertainties in the form of quantum which can be regarded as an extension of classical Dempster-Shafer (DS) evidence theory. However, how to handle uncertainties in the form of quantum is still an open issue. In this paper, a new method is proposed to dispose uncertain quantum information, which is called two-dimensional quantum mass function (TDQMF). A TDQMF is consist of two elements, T=(Q 1, Q 2), both of the Q s are quantum mass functions, in which the Q 2 is an indicator of the reliability on Q 1. More flexibility and effectiveness are offered in handling uncertainty in the field of quantum by the proposed method compared with original quantum mass function. Besides, some numerical examples are provided and some practical applications are given to verify its correctness and validity.
