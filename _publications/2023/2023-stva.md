  Leaf Area Index (LAI) is one of the most important biophysical parameters of vegetation, and its dynamic changes can be used as a reflective indicator and differentiation basis of vegetation function. In this study, a VCA–MLC (Vertex Component Analysis–Maximum Likelihood Classification) algorithm is proposed from the perspective of multi-temporal satellite LAI image classification to monitor and quantify the spatial and temporal variability of vegetation dynamics in China since 2000. The algorithm extracts the vegetation endmembers from 46 multi-temporal images of MODIS LAI in 2011 without the aid of other a priori knowledge and uses the maximum likelihood classification method to select the categories that satisfy the requirements of the number of missing periods, absolute distance, and relative distance for the rest pixels to be classified, ultimately dividing the vegetation area of China into 10 vegetation zones called China Vegetation Functional Zones (CVFZ). CVFZ outperforms MCD12Q1 and CLCD land cover datasets in the overall differentiation of vegetation functions and can be used synergistically with other land cover datasets.
